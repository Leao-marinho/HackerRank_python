"""
Finding the percentage

You have a record of N students. Each record contains the student's name, 
and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. 
The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer N
followed by the names and marks for N students. 
You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. 
The user then enters a student's name. 
Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, 
correct to two decimal places.

Input Format:
The first line contains the integer N, the number of students. 
The next N lines contains the name and marks obtained by that student 
separated by a space. The final line contains 
the name of a particular student previously listed.

Constraints:
    2 <= N <= 10
    0 <= Marks <= 100

Output Format:
Print one line: The average of the marks obtained 
by the particular student correct to 2 decimal places.

Sample Input:
3
Krishna 67 68 69
Arjun 70 98 63
Malika 52 56 60
Malika

Sample Output:
56.00

Explanation:
Marks for Malika are {52,56,60}  whose average is 52+56+60 / 3 = 56
